## Test Statistics

-   **Total Test Cases**: 196+
-   **Test Files**: 12 files
-   **All Tests**: ✅ Passing

## Coverage Analysis

### What's Covered

-   ✅ **Tool Registration**: All registration functions are tested
-   ✅ **Request Structure Validation**: Parameter structures are verified
-   ✅ **Helper Functions**: Test utilities have high coverage (100% for utilities)
-   ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: All test helpers are fully covered

### What's Not Covered (Expected)

-   ❌ **API Handler Functions**: Tool handlers that make actual API calls
    -   Reason: Requires mocking the `gobizfly.Client` which uses private fields
    -   Impact: Lower overall coverage percentage
    -   Solution: Would require dependency injection or interface-based design

### Why Coverage is 13.0%

The current coverage focuses on:

1. **Tool Registration** (~8-14% per file): Tests verify tools are registered without errors
2. **Request Structure** (~0%): Parameter structures are validated but handler execution is not tested
3. **Helper Functions** (~40-100%): Test utilities have good coverage

The actual tool handler functions that execute API calls are not covered because:

-   They require a real or mocked `gobizfly.Client`
-   The SDK uses private fields making it difficult to mock without complex infrastructure
-   Integration tests would require actual Bizfly Cloud credentials

## Improving Coverage

To improve coverage, you would need to:

1. **Refactor for Dependency Injection**:

    ```go
    // Instead of direct client access
    type ServerToolHandler struct {
        client CloudServerClient // interface
    }
    ```

2. **Create Mock Interfaces**:

    ```go
    type CloudServerClient interface {
        List(ctx context.Context, opts *gobizfly.ServerListOptions) ([]*gobizfly.Server, error)
        Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (*gobizfly.Server, error)
        // ... other methods
    }
    ```

3. **Use Mocking Libraries**:

    - `testify/mock`
    - `gomock`
    - Custom mocks for each service

4. **Add Integration Tests**:
    - Tests against actual Bizfly Cloud API (with test account)
    - Requires real credentials and may incur costs

## Generating Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate coverage profile
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# View coverage in terminal
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Generate HTML report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
open coverage.html
```

## Test Quality

Despite lower coverage percentage, the tests provide:

-   ✅ **Structural Validation**: Ensures all tools are properly registered
-   ✅ **Parameter Validation**: Verifies request structures are correct
-   ✅ **Error Prevention**: Catches issues during development
-   ✅ **Documentation**: Tests serve as examples of tool usage

The tests follow best practices for MCP server testing by focusing on what can be reliably tested without external dependencies.
